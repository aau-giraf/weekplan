# Welcome to Weekplanner app ðŸ‘‹

This is the **WeekPlanner App** for the Giraf system, a project developed at Aalborg University to support autistic children with little or no verbal communication. The app stores daily schedules and educational activities. This is the front-end component of the WeekPlanner, responsible for delivering an intuitive user interface for managing schedules. 

It relies on the **WeekPlanner-API** for functionality, including data retrieval, user authentication, and synchronisation with the production database.

## Get started
To run the application, make sure you have the following configured or downloaded:
- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

After running the above command, you will see options to open the app in a:
- Development build
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go

The app uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), so you can start customising by editing files in the app directory.
