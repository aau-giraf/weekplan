# Welcome to Weekplanner app 👋

This is the **WeekPlanner App** for the GIRAF project developed at Aalborg University to support autistic children with little or no verbal communication. The app stores daily schedules and educational activities. This is the frontend component of the WeekPlanner, responsible for delivering an intuitive user interface for managing schedules. 

It relies on the **WeekPlanner-API** for functionality, including data retrieval, user authentication, and synchronisation with the production database.

## Get started
To run the application, make sure you have the following configured or downloaded:
- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

After running the above command, you will see options to open the app in a:
- Development build
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go

The app uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), so you can start customising by editing files in the app directory.
